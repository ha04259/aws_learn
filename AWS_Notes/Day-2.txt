Day-2 AWS-B36-Regions-AZ-DatacenterArch-IPAddressing:

AWS Regions and AZ's Reference:https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/?p=ngi&loc=1

1. AWS Regions: Geographical location
examples: us-west-2(Oregon), us-east-2(ohia)

2. AWS Availability Zones:
us-west-2 -- is a region
region can have multiple AZ's
us-west-2a, us-west-2b, us-west-2c
Why AZ's: Distribute workloads across different AZ's (Instead of keeping all servers in one AZ spread across different AZ's. this will help no down time)
How to choose region: https://cloudping.info/

Disaster Recovery: If us-west-2 down (then we need to choose Disaster recovery and choose another region us-east-2)


3. Datacenter Architecture:
AWS Datacenter: RACK-1 RACK-2 RACK-3 RACK-4
RACKS have Physical server
Physical server have multiple virtual machines

4. Basic Networking
- IP Addressing (two types IPV4 and IPV6)
4.1) IPV4 --> 32-bit example: 10.1.1.100
0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255

IPV4 are divided into 5 classes : https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/IPv4-address-class
Class A: 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255
Private Range for Class A: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255

Class B: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
Private Range for Class A: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255

Class C: 192 to 223.255.255.255
Private Range for Class A: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

4.2) IPV6 --> 
- Subnetting
Dividing address spaces into subnets
